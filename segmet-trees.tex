\begin{abstract}
This document provides an overview of segment trees. In the first place
I will describe some algebraic topics which are necessary for better
understanding how and why segment trees works. This knowledge will be useful
for reading the rest of the paper where We will dive into different kinds of trees.
For each structure, I will explain how it work and how to apply it to problems.
Then, I will look at each structure's time complexity and space complexity.

\section{Foundations of Segment Trees}
A segment tree is a binary tree used for storing information about segments. 
To efficently retrieve or update informations about elements stored 
in segment tree we can perform various operations most common of which are
query/update on point or range.
One of the examples can be maximum value of 
elements in given range or sum of elements in given range.

\subsection{Segment Tree with point update and range query}
To ilustrate use case of segment tree we will construct tree with max value on segment.
Let's say we are given an array \(A = [5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 25, 28, 20]\) of length \(n = 8\).
For now let's assume that the input array is of size \(n = 2^{k}\) where \(k\) is integer (for different
sizes of input we will fill input array with neutral elements (see section 2) to make it's length a power of 2).
The height of tree is \(h = \log_2{n}\). Let's define \(dep(i)\) as depth of node i in our tree.
We can see that \(dep(root) = 0\) and \(dep(leaf) = h\).
We want to be able to perform the following operations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Build structure} \\
    We will create a segment tree from an array.
    To build a segment tree, we need to create a binary tree where each node will store the maximum value of elements in its subtree. \\
    \input{pseudo-codes/seg-tree-build.tex}

    \item \textbf{Point update} \\
    Now let's update single value in the array and update the tree.
    We will change the value of \(A[1]\) from 10 to 35.
    To update the tree we need to change the value of the leaf node 
    and then update all the parent nodes up to the root.
    \input{pseudo-codes/point-update.tex}
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \input{structures/seg-tree-2.tex}
        \caption{Example of point update.}
        \label{fig:segment_tree_2}
    \end{figure}

    \item \textbf{Range query} \\
    Now let's say we want to find the maximum value in the range \(A[2:7]\).
    To do this we need to traverse the tree from the root to the leaves and 
    find nodes that are in the range. Then we will get max the values of these nodes to get the final result.
    To get the result for range \(A[2:7]\) we call \(RangeQuery(seg, 1, 1, 8, 2, 7)\).

    \input{pseudo-codes/range-query.tex}

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \input{structures/seg-tree-3.tex}
        \caption{Example of range query. Blue leafs represents subarray \(A[2:7]\). Green nodes 
        represents nodes where ranges totally overlap and we can get max value. The result of the query is 30.}
        \label{fig:segment_tree_3}
    \end{figure}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Segment Tree with range update and range query}
A Little more complex version of segment tree is a segment tree with range update and range query which require \textbf{lazy propagation}.
We will consider a segment tree with sum of elements in given range. 
Apart form values in tree we will also store lazy values in each node.
The lazy value is used to delay the update of a node until it is needed.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Build structure} 
    Only difference form previus example is initializig the lazy value for all nodes \\
    \input{pseudo-codes/seg-tree-build-2.tex}\\


    \item \textbf{Range update} \\
    In this case lazy value is a value that we want to add to all elements in the range.
    Another way to think about this is that we want to add lazy value to all elenets in arrary 
    which are represented by all leaves in subtree of given node.
    \input{pseudo-codes/range-update.tex} \\
    How this algorithm works:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If the current node is fully in range update the sum of the node and set the lazy value. Sum - $value*size$ where $size$ is the number of array elements (leafs) in the range of this node, Lazy is equal to $value$, which we will later push down to child nodes.
        \item If not fully in range push the lazy value down to the child nodes and update their sum and also reset the lazy value for the current node.
        \item Call the function recursively for the left and right child nodes.
        \item Finally update the sum of the current node with the sum of its children.
    \end{enumerate}
    On the following example we will update the range \(A[0:5]\) by adding 10 to all elements in this range
    where initial array is \(A = [5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 25, 20, 20]\).
    
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \input{structures/seg-tree-4.tex}
        \caption{This is state of the tree after range update. Green nodes were changed during the update.}
        \label{fig:segment_tree_4}
    \end{figure}

    \item \textbf{Range query} 
    We will try to retrieve the sum of some given range. The algorithm for this will be simiar to the one for range update.
    First we will check if the current node is fully in range. If it is we add the sum of this node, propagating lazy values along the way.

        \centering
        \input{structures/seg-tree-5.tex}
        \caption{This is state of the tree after range query on range [2: 4]. Green nodes were we took values form to the sum. Result of query is 95.}

\end{itemize}



\subsection{Monoids}
A monoid \( (S, e, \ast) \) is a set equipped with an associative binary operation \( S \times S \to S \) and
an identity element \(e\). 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Associativity} \\
    For all \( a, b, c \in S \), \( (a \ast b) \ast c = a \ast (b \ast c) \).
    \item \textbf{Identity element} \\
    There exists an element \( e \in S \) such that for all \( a \in S \), \( a \ast e = e \ast a = a \).
\end{itemize}
